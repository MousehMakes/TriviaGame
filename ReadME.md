This is a trivia game about space.

Ten questions get displayed, one by one. The user has the opportunity to guess from 4 choices, by clicking on the one they think is correct.

If the user guesses correctly, a congratulatory screen is shown for 3-5 seconds, after which the game displays the next question. 

If the user guesses wrong, a lose screen is shown for 3-5 seconds and also documents the correct answer.

At the end of the quiz, a screen is displayed that shows your number of correct and incorrect answers, and provides a reset button which allows you to try again.
